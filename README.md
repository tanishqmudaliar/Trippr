## Pages & Routes

| Route             | Page       | Access    | Purpose                 |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| `/`               | Landing    | Public    | Welcome & feature intro |
| `/dashboard`      | Dashboard  | Protected | Stats overview          |
| `/entries`        | Entries    | Protected | Manage duty entries     |
| `/invoice`        | Invoice    | Protected | Create/edit invoices    |
| `/statistics`     | Statistics | Protected | Analytics & charts      |
| `/settings`       | Settings   | Protected | App configuration       |
| `/setup`          | Setup      | Public    | First-time wizard       |
| `/privacy`        | Privacy    | Public    | Privacy Policy          |
| `/terms`          | Terms      | Public    | Terms of Service        |
| `/oauth-callback` | OAuth      | Public    | Google OAuth handler    |

**Route Protection**:

- `SetupGuard` redirects to `/setup` if setup is not complete
- Checks for branding assets (logo/signature) - redirects returning users to complete branding if missing
- Public pages (`/privacy`, `/terms`, `/oauth-callback`) accessible without setup
- Allows existing data to be pre-populated for returning users

## Data Types

### DutyEntry

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  clientId: string;
  date: string;              // Start date (ISO)
  endDate?: string;          // End date for multi-day
  dutyId: string;            // 8-digit random ID (unique)
  startingKms: number;
  closingKms: number;
  timeIn: string;            // "HH:MM"
  timeOut: string;           // "HH:MM"
  tollParking: number;
  additionalCharges: { label: string; amount: number }[];

  // Cancelled entry tracking
  isCancelled?: boolean;     // Mark as cancelled
  cancelReason?: string;     // Reason for cancellation

  // Auto-calculated (excluded if cancelled)
  totalKms: number;
  totalTime: number;         // Decimal hours
  extraKms: number;
  extraTime: number;
}
```

### Client

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  name: string;
  baseKmsPerDay: number; // Included KMs
  baseHoursPerDay: number; // Included hours
  perDayRate: number; // ₹ per day
  extraKmRate: number; // ₹ per extra KM
  extraHourRate: number; // ₹ per extra hour
  serviceTaxPercent: number; // Tax %
}
```

### Invoice

```typescript
{
  id: string;
  invoiceNumber: string;
  invoiceDate: string;
  clientId: string;
  vehicleNumberForInvoice: string;
  entryIds: string[];        // Referenced entries

  // Calculated totals
  totalDays: number;
  totalExtraKms: number;
  totalExtraHours: number;
  perDayAmount: number;
  extraKmsAmount: number;
  extraHoursAmount: number;
  subTotal: number;
  serviceTax: number;
  grandTotal: number;
  tollParking: number;
  additionalCharges: number;
  netTotal: number;
  roundedTotal: number;
}
```

---

## Cancelled Entries

### How It Works

Cancelled entries are marked as `isCancelled: true` and include an optional `cancelReason`. These entries:

- **Excluded from calculations**: Do not contribute to invoice totals or statistics
- **Visually distinct**: Shown with strikethrough text and "CANCELLED" badge
- **Not billable**: Cannot be selected for invoices
- **Preserved in records**: Remain in the system for auditing purposes

### Display

- **Entries page**: Red badge with strikethrough, shows cancel reason in details
- **Invoice PDF**: Shown with grey strikethrough and "CANCELLED" badge
- **Statistics**: Completely excluded from all calculations

### Use Cases

- Driver sick/unavailable
- Vehicle breakdown
- Client cancellation
- Weather/emergency cancellations

---

## Branding & Customization

### Company Logo & Signature

Upload custom branding assets that appear on PDF invoices:

**Upload Requirements**:

- **Formats**: PNG, JPG, JPEG (auto-converted to PNG)
- **Size**: Max 2MB per file
- **Storage**: IndexedDB (offline access)
- **Recommendation**: PNG format for best quality

**Where They Appear**:

- **Logo**: Top-left of invoice header
- **Signature**: Bottom-right of invoice footer

**Setup**:

1. Navigate to Settings → Logo & Signature
2. Click "Upload Logo" or "Upload Signature"
3. Select image file (PNG/JPG/JPEG)
4. System automatically converts JPEG to PNG for PDF compatibility

**Technical Details**:

- JPEG images are converted to PNG using HTML5 Canvas
- Conversion prevents `@react-pdf/renderer` JPEG compatibility issues
- Assets stored in IndexedDB database (`trippr_assets`)
- No environment variables required

---

## Backup & Restore

### Local Backup

Export your entire application data as a JSON file:

**What's Included**:

- All duty entries
- All invoices
- Company information
- User profile
- Clients and vehicles
- Backup configuration
- Branding completion status

**Export Process**:

1. Settings → Backup section → "Export Backup"
2. Optional: Enable encryption with custom key
3. Download JSON file: `trippr-backup-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss.json`

**Restore Process**:

1. Setup wizard welcome screen → "Restore from Backup"
2. Or Settings → "Restore from Backup"
3. Select backup JSON file
4. If encrypted, enter encryption key
5. Confirm restoration (overwrites current data)

### Encryption

**AES-GCM Encryption**:

- Optional encryption using Web Crypto API
- User-provided encryption key (not stored)
- 256-bit key derived from password using PBKDF2
- Encrypted data structure:
  ```json
  {
    "encrypted": "base64-encoded-ciphertext",
    "iv": "base64-initialization-vector",
    "salt": "base64-salt-for-key-derivation"
  }
  ```

**Important**: If you lose your encryption key, the backup cannot be recovered!

### Cloud Sync (Google Drive)

Sync your data across devices using Google Drive:

**Features**:

- **Secure Storage**: Data stored in hidden `appDataFolder` (not visible in your Drive)
- **Manual Sync**: Click "Sync Now" to upload/download data
- **Conflict Resolution**: Choose between local or cloud data when conflicts occur
- **Silent Token Refresh**: Automatic token refresh - no re-login needed (as long as you stay logged into Google)
- **Download Cloud Data**: Export cloud backup as JSON file
- **Clear Cloud Data**: Delete all cloud data when needed

**Setup**:

1. Settings → Cloud Sync → "Connect Google Drive"
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Grant permission for app-specific storage
4. Click "Sync Now" to upload your data

**What's Synced**:

- All duty entries and invoices
- Company info and user profile
- Clients and vehicles
- Logo and signature images
- Backup configuration

**OAuth Scopes Used**:

- `drive.appdata` - Access to hidden app folder only
- `email` - Display your email in the app
- `profile` - Display your name in the app

**Privacy**: We never access your regular Google Drive files. Data is stored in an isolated app folder that only Trippr can access. You can revoke access anytime from [Google Account Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions).

## Invoice Calculation Logic

### Per Entry

```
Total KMs = Closing KMs - Starting KMs
Total Hours = Time Out - Time In (handles overnight)

Day Count = (End Date - Start Date) + 1  // or 1 for single-day

Base KMs = Client's Base KMs/Day × Day Count
Base Hours = Client's Base Hours/Day × Day Count

Extra KMs = max(0, Total KMs - Base KMs)
Extra Hours = max(0, Total Hours - Base Hours)
```

### Invoice Totals

```
Per Day Amount = Total Days × Per Day Rate
Extra KMs Amount = Extra KMs × Extra KM Rate
Extra Hours Amount = Extra Hours × Extra Hour Rate

Sub Total = Per Day + Extra KMs + Extra Hours
Service Tax = Sub Total × Tax%
Grand Total = Sub Total + Service Tax
Net Total = Grand Total + Toll/Parking + Additional Charges
Rounded Total = Math.round(Net Total)
```

---

## Multi-Day Entry System

### Three Modes

1. **Same Daily**
   - Same start/end times each day
   - Total time = (timeOut - timeIn) × dayCount

2. **Total Hours**
   - User enters total hours manually
   - Useful for irregular schedules

3. **Per Day**
   - Different times for each day
   - Most flexible option

### Day Count Calculation

```typescript
function getEntryDayCount(entry) {
  if (!entry.endDate) return 1;

  const start = new Date(entry.date);
  const end = new Date(entry.endDate);
  const diffDays = Math.ceil((end - start) / 86400000);

  return diffDays + 1; // Inclusive
}
```

---

## File Import

### Supported Formats

- Excel: `.xlsx`, `.xls`
- CSV: `.csv`

### Column Detection

The system auto-detects columns by keywords:

| Column       | Keywords                   |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Date         | date, Date, DATE           |
| Duty ID      | dutyId, duty_id, duty      |
| Starting KMs | startKms, start_kms, open  |
| Closing KMs  | closeKms, close_kms, close |
| Time In      | timeIn, time_in, in        |
| Time Out     | timeOut, time_out, out     |
| Toll         | toll, tollParking, parking |

### Import Flow

1. Select file
2. Auto-parse and detect columns
3. Preview entries in table

---

## Storage & Limitations

### Dual Storage System

Trippr uses two browser storage mechanisms:

**localStorage** (Main Data):

- Company info, user profile
- Duty entries and invoices
- Clients and vehicles
- Backup configuration

**IndexedDB** (Assets):

- Company logo
- Signature image
- Stored as base64 PNG data URLs

This hybrid approach enables:

- **Offline functionality** - No internet required
- **Privacy** - Data stays on your device
- **No server costs** - Everything runs locally
- **Asset persistence** - Images survive cache clearing

### Storage Capacity

| Entries | Invoices | Estimated Size | Status              |
| ------- | -------- | -------------- | ------------------- |
| 500     | 100      | ~150 KB        | Safe                |
| 2,000   | 400      | ~600 KB        | Safe                |
| 5,000   | 1,000    | ~1.5 MB        | **Recommended Max** |
| 10,000+ | 2,000+   | ~3-4 MB        | Risk of issues      |

**Browser localStorage limit**: 5-10 MB (varies by browser)

**Recommendation**: Keep under **5,000 entries** for optimal performance.

### Known Limitations

| Limitation            | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single User**       | No multi-user or access control                    |
| **Browser Dependent** | Clearing browser data deletes local copy           |
| **Storage Cap**       | ~5,000 entries recommended maximum                 |
| **Manual Sync**       | Cloud sync requires manual trigger (not automatic) |

### Data Safety Tips

1. **Enable Cloud Sync** - Connect Google Drive for cross-device backup
2. **Don't clear browser data** - All your local data is in localStorage/IndexedDB
3. **Regular cloud syncs** - Sync to Google Drive before switching devices
4. **Regular backups** - Export backup JSON files regularly
5. **Keep backup safe** - If encrypted, remember your encryption key
6. **Download invoices** - Keep PDF copies as records
7. **Regular browser** - Don't use incognito/private mode

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Data not saving"

- Ensure localStorage is not disabled in browser settings
- Check if storage quota is exceeded
- Try clearing old entries if storage is full

### "PDF not generating"

- Ensure all required fields are filled in company settings
- Check browser console for errors
- Try with fewer entries if the PDF is too large

### "Import not working"

- Verify file format (.xlsx, .xls, or .csv)
- Check that column headers match expected keywords
- Ensure dates are in recognizable format

### "Charts not displaying"

- Ensure there are entries in the selected time range
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Try refreshing the page

### "Setup wizard keeps appearing"

- Complete all setup steps
- Check if localStorage is working properly
- Try a different browser
